This project reads ECHAM-HAM data of emission flux and burden to generate global and regional plots.
The conda environment for this project is contained in env.yml file. Please, run <conda activate env.yml> to set up the environment for this project.

Run main.py to create the figures of emission flux and burden of total marine organic aerosols (PCHO + DCAA + PL). The first part of the script generates the global plots (Fig. 6 of Leon-Marcos et al. 2024). It depends on the global fields generated using the model output with the bash scripts in folder "extract".  
The second part of main.py script generates the Arctic plot for each organic aerosol group per season as defined with the variable "months".
